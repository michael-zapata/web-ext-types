TypeScript type definitions for WebExtensions

## Requirements

As this library is using the `object` type, `typescript` should at least be on
version `2.2` to get the definitions to work.

## Install it

There is no npm package for now, which means you can only grab it from the
repository:

```sh
# yarn version
yarn add michael-zapata/web-ext-types --dev

# npm version
npm install --save-dev michael-zapata/web-ext-types
```
